In this project, I built a Product Dashboard for a business using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The dashboard fetches and displays product data from an external API. 
I used fetch(), .then(), async/await, try, and catch to handle asynchronous operations. 
I also enhanced the user interface with interactive hover effects for product cards.
